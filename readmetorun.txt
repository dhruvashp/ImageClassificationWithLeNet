codes can be run if

1. appropriate libraries on local machine have been downloaded (or containers).

2. download code has been run so that the data can be referenced internally/mounted internally.

3. run results are already available in the notebooks. thus, as such need to run the notebooks is not necessary, all the results have been attached.
