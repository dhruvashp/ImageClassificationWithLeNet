# ImageClassificationWithLeNet

The above repository corresponds to an assignment performed for the course Advanced Computer Vision taken under Prof. Ram Nevatia at USC (fall 2021)

The task is a simple image classification network using a LeNet style architecture - the code is written to run on CPU and should run relatively quickly due to the simple nature of the architecture.

The download.py folder has been forked from another user to decompress and organize the STL10 dataset into train, val and test sets.

Various results have been incorporated into the codebase and into the report PDF and referring those can help one get started.

To experiment with the code, run the download.py file to generate the dataset and download it locally, and then run the code files - the insight and variation file is specific to my code run and shouldn't ideally be used to run the code (variation contains some hyperparameter tuning attempt and modifies the scheduler and optimizer as a sub-task for the assignment).
