splits folder
contains 3 files - train, val, test
each text file contains all the locations for the corresponding split in the form of -
image location + class it belongs to

classes are from 0 to 9 (1 to 10 in relevant folders)
corresponds to the class file in data

val is obviously within the test folder

so,

files in splits point to corresponding split locations in the test and train folder

location is relative location with respect to the current directory (where this file is, code file is, etc.)
